## Weekly Task 1 - bmi
> 1. Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). Call the file bmi.py
> - The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms.
> - The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.
>
>$ python bmi.py  
>Enter weight: 65  
>Enter height: 180
>
>BMI is 20.06.

### Solution

## Weekly Task 2 - secondString
>  Write a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.   
>
> $ python secondstring.py   
> Please enter a sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.   
>
> .o zletrv pu o wr cu h   

### Solution

## Weekly Task 3 - collatz
> Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.   
> At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.   
> Have the program end if the current value is one.
>
> $ python collatz.py   
> Please enter a positive integer: 10    
>
> 10 5 16 8 4 2 1    

### Solution

## Weekly Task 4 - weekday
> Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.   
> (You will need to search the web to find how you work out what day it is)   
> An example of running this program on a Thursday is given below.   
>
> $ python weekday.py   
>
> Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.   
> 
> An example of running it on a Saturday is as follows:   
> 
> $ python weekday.py   
>
> It is the weekend, yay! 

### Solution

## Weekly Task 5 - squareRoot
> Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
>
> You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
>  
> I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
>
> This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would use one of the above methods).
>
> I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.
>
> This is a more difficult task than some of the others, but will be marked equally, so only do as much work on this as you feel comfortable.
> 
> $ python squareroot.py   
> Please enter a positive number: 14.5   
> The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.   

### Solution

## Weekly Task 6 - numberOfEs
> Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.  
> The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line.
> 
> $ python es.py moby-dick.txt   
> 116960 

### Solution

## Weekly Task 7 - plotTask
> Write a program called plottask.py that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
>
> Some marks will be given for making the plot look nice.
